## TwitterUserScraper for Python 3 

This project is simply a refactoring of another GitHub project repository:  https://github.com/scoliann/TwitterUserScraper


The only difference is scoliann's project is written in Python 2 and I needed it in Python 3.

Please refer to soliann's project as it gives a great overview of what the program does, project dependencies, etc.
